# Proposal: task-p6-0-debian-support-plan

## Why
mdoctor is currently macOS-first. We need a phased, low-risk plan to add Linux support, scoped to Debian-based systems only in the first iteration.

## Scope
- In scope:
  - Define Debian-only support boundaries and non-goals.
  - Break Linux support into phased OpenSpec tasks.
  - Define acceptance criteria and quality gates per phase.
- Out of scope:
  - Implement Linux runtime changes in this task.
  - Support non-Debian distributions in this first plan.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] A dedicated plan doc exists for Debian support.
- [x] OpenSpec tasks include a new Linux phase with sequenced tasks.
- [x] Plan defines explicit non-goals and rollout gates.

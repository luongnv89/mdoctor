# Design: task-p4-3-safety-recovery-docs

## Approach
1. Add `docs/SAFETY.md` with sections:
   - Safety model and layers
   - Configuration controls (whitelist/scope)
   - Operation logs and diagnostics
   - Recovery playbook
   - Known limitations
2. Update README documentation links and cleanup section pointer.
3. Update Guidebook tips to reference safety/recovery guide.

## Files Affected
- `docs/SAFETY.md` (new)
- `README.md`
- `docs/GUIDEBOOK.md`

## Validation Plan
- Verify links and paths exist.
- Ensure docs mention current command names/flags.
